# Neural network

The code contains my very own build of neural network. Squared error function is used for error measure and tanh is used as the activation function in the Neural network.<br/> 

Gradient descent implementations performed:<br/>
1) vanilla gradient descent<br/>
2) stochastic gradient descent<br/>
3) mini-batch gradient descent<br/>


The error versus iterations graph is also plotted for these implementations.<br/>

Also, this neural network is used to classify the 'mnist' dataset.
